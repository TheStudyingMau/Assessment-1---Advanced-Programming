# Assessment 1 - Advanced Programming (Python)
This repository consists of my accomplishments in Python coding presenting my thoughts on going throuhg quizes and study sites to expand my knowledge in Python.

My Python coding skills are presented through 3 exercises that has specific challenges, goals, and requirements to meet. 

# Brief Synopsis
The assessment teaches us to make use of the Tkinter module for display of GUI, making functions to simplify code, and accessing different modules to achieve the required results and smaller lines.

Tkinter was taught through our classes, but expanding our knowledge in Python was from going through online courses (SoloLearn, Cisco) to learn more about Python (for code improvement) and earn our required degrees.

Afterwards, we get to exercise our knowledge through 3 exercises.
Each exercises had us build our code with new techniques in mind with new tools to use after learning through our courses:

## Exercise 1 - Math Quiz: 
We were tasked to make a math quiz that has 3 difficulties: Easy, Moderate, and Hard. All of the equations would either be addition or subtraction. If you picked Easy, you would only deal with 1 digits being added together. If it were Moderate, it would be two digits being added together. If it were hard, it would be 4 digits. The quiz would also have a scoring system that grades the user based on how they performed throughout the quizes. The quiz would not be ruthless as it would give you a chance to get it right once, except it will only reward you half the points you're supposed to earn.

All of this were
