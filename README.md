# Assessment 1 - Advanced Programming (Python)
This repository consists of my accomplishments in Python coding presenting my thoughts on going throuhg quizes and study sites to expand my knowledge in Python.

My Python coding skills are presented through 3 exercises that has specific challenges, goals, and requirements to meet. 

# Brief Synopsis
The assessment teaches us to make use of the Tkinter module for display of GUI, making functions to simplify code, and accessing different modules to achieve the required results and smaller lines.

Tkinter was taught through our classes, but expanding our knowledge in Python was from going through online courses **(SoloLearn, Cisco)** to learn more about Python (for code improvement) and earn our required degrees.

Afterwards, we get to exercise our knowledge through 3 exercises.
Each exercises had us build our code with new techniques in mind with new tools to use after learning through our courses:

**Exercise 1 - Math Quiz**<br>
**Exercise 2 - Alexa Tell Me A Joke**<br>
**Exercise 3 - Student Manager**

## Exercise 1 - Math Quiz: 
We were tasked to make a math quiz that has 3 difficulties: Easy, Moderate, and Hard. All of the equations would either be addition or subtraction. If you picked Easy, you would only deal with 1 digits being added together. If it were Moderate, it would be two digits being added together. If it were hard, it would be 4 digits. The quiz would also have a scoring system that grades the user based on how they performed throughout the quizes. The quiz would not be ruthless as it would give you a chance to get it right once, except it will only reward you half the points you're supposed to earn.

Tkinter helped us code the necessary GUI for the exercise, and the Python is responsible to make the GUI function and get the results needed. It was a good refresher to Python and exercise to apply what we learned from our online courses with a bit more expanded knowledge in Python. I made use of modules that imports access for pseudo-random values to have randomized equations. With research, I learned more options of code to use outside the lectures and online courses to get the results I wanted.

## Exercise 2 -  Alexa Tell Me A Joke:
While Exercise 1 was a good challenge, Exercise 2 might be either simple or tougher than our first. The simple part is that the output required is only small. It only requires us to output the jokes from the txt.file by functions that would be called by the Tkinter buttons. There's also a comedic timing to it so the question is first displayed and the punchline is called when the button is clicked, activating the function for it.

The exercise helped us learn how to access files in Python. Sometimes the directories won't work so I had to research and learn how to store specific directories in variables to call the file. The challenge in coding this exercise is the line count. We were only limited to 100 lines. Therefore, we had to make our code compact as possible. (no redundant code or complex algorithms) This pushed us to make maximum use of Python and its modules.

## Exercise 3 - Student Manager:
The final challenge proved to be a fun but challenging activity. A link to Loom gave us a reference to how we should display our GUI. Working on the design first was a helpful move as we can make progress without being delayed. From the txt.file that contains student records, we were required to display the student's: name, student id, total course work, exam marks, percentage, and grade. Outside of it, we are also to display the average percentage from all students and the amount of students present. We were also required to view the student's details only when selected and view the highest scoring student and the lowest.

After finishing with the GUI, the system took trial and errors to figure out what are the required functions to achieve the goal. I used TTK's comboboxes as a way to select students to view their details. OS was used to find the exact directory of the file as opening the file failed to locate it. Min() and Max() functions helped me narrow down the code to find the largest and the lowest scoring students. Saved me trouble from having a long code to deal with a limited code of lines required. Due to the demand of compact lines, I learned to practice using short formed for-loops, assigning variables in one code, and grouping objects in one line. 

## Personal Thoughts

Having learned Tkinter and going through Intermediate Python Courses helped me open doors from console-only systems to different GUI-based applications. It helped me learn ways to make my code more simple and compact, make use of modules available in Python to get the desired result, and learned to achieve a more smoother and readable algorithms.

Going through the exercises is admittedly fun. It helped me see the power of Python and how I can maximize its use to make playful or practical applications. It is at first difficult to comprehend. I have trouble understanding OOP in Python and the system-level modules such as os, but undeniably, these things has helped me understand the structure of Python and how big Python is in the world of coding. However, I fail to apply to my exercises.

I wouldn't say I wasted my time not applying all of it. There is some regret, but I'm proud of how much I learned through the exercises, lectures, and courses necessary for my assessment. This definetely contributed to my growth in coding.
